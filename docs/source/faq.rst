Can I setup a Virtual Machine (VM) instead of installing Ubuntu on dual boot?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Technically you can use a VM, but it is not recommended as the performance will be sluggish due to resouces division on you host OS and the VM.

Is is madatory to install/use Ubuntu only, can I install any other linux distro?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Yes, you can install/use any other distro for installation of ROS and Gazebo, but ROS and Gazebo integrate very well with Ubuntu. On other distros 
(especially non-debian based) there may arise some issues during installation of packages.
